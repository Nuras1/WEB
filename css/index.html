                        <h2>Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing"</h2><br>
                        It's the same thing as the previous fight. If it's a first round finish, I'd back Conor. From
                        the
                        second and further, then Dustin wins.<br> The Russian - who retired in March with a record of
                        29-0 with eight knockouts - has submission victories over both McGregor and Poirier, so he knows
                        a thing or two about
                        their game plans and skillsets.<br> He memorably scaled the Octagon at UFC 229 after defeating
                        McGregor to attack his
                        cornerman Dillon Danis, who had reportedly shouted insults at Khabib following the fight. The
                        Russian has turned to promoting following his retirement and is mentoring fellow
                        lightweight Islam Makhachev - currently ranked #9 in the UFC rankings.
